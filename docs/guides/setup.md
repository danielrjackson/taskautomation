# Installation Instructions for Task Automation

Here's how to set up `taskautomation` for local development:

1. Check out the code from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danielrjackson/taskautomation
   ```

2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/taskautomation.git
   ```

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv.
   Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development:

   ```bash
   cd taskautomation
   uv init .
   ```

4. Create a branch for local development:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. Ensure that your feature or commit is fully covered by tests.
   If you added new functionality, make sure to add tests for it.
   If you fixed a bug, make sure to add a test that reproduces the bug.
   This will help ensure that the bug is fixed and that it doesn't come back in the future.

6. Run the tests to make sure everything is working as expected:

   Uses `pytest-cov`, `coverage`, and `pytest` to run the tests and check coverage:

   ```bash
   pytest --cov=taskautomation --cov-report=html
   ```

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
   git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
