# Task Workflow Automation Planning

This directory contains the planning documents for automating the task workflow process.

## Planning Documents

### [AI Agent Considerations](ai_agent_considerations.md) ðŸ¤–

**Key document** - Design principles for making AI agents' lives easier:

- Structured JSON output formats for machine parsing
- Standardized CLI interfaces and exit codes
- Machine-readable status queries and error handling
- Batch operations with progress tracking
- Self-documenting scripts with schema information

### [Modular Automation Plan](modular_automation_plan.md)

The main automation plan following a modular "check your work" approach:

- Single-purpose scripts that can be used independently
- "Check your work" dry-run modes for validation
- Building on the successful pattern of [`run_tests.py`](../../scripts/dev/run_tests.py)
- Composable scripts that work together or separately

### [Task Wrap-up Script Plan](task_wrapup_script_plan.md)  

Detailed implementation plan for the first priority script: `finish_tasks.py`:

- Find completed tasks missing finish times
- Add finish timestamps and move to Archive section
- Generate structured summaries for change entries and git commits
- AI-friendly JSON output for automated processing

### [Original Automation Plan](automation_plan.md)

Initial automation plan (kept for reference). This was the more monolithic approach before we refined it to be modular.

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Task wrap-up script (`finish_tasks.py`) with AI-friendly interfaces
2. **Phase 2**: Core task management scripts (`create_task.py`, `update_task.py`, `archive_tasks.py`)  
3. **Phase 3**: Validation enhancement (`validate_changes.py`)
4. **Phase 4**: Change management (`generate_change_entry.py`, `prepare_commit.py`)

## Design Principles

- **AI-Friendly**: Structured JSON output, predictable interfaces, machine-readable status
- **Modular**: Each script does one thing well
- **Independent**: Scripts can be used standalone for validation
- **Composable**: Scripts can be chained together when needed
- **Safe**: All scripts support dry-run modes and validation
- **Consistent**: Follow patterns established by existing scripts like `run_tests.py`

The goal is to automate the "startup/finish up" parts of the task workflow while leaving the "do the work" part to human/AI intelligence, with special emphasis on making AI agents' automation tasks as easy and reliable as possible.
